= Situation =
The targeted cluster computer environment looks like this:

We have a couple of file servers with large storage backends and a
large number of compute nodes. All components are connect by (gigabit)
ethernet. The file server storage is available on all compute nodes
using a network file system like NFS. Each of the compute nodes has a
local (e.g. SATA attached) hard disk of customary size.
