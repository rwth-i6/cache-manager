cm-client.py

 Uses the configuration in ~/.cmclient
 (see cmclient.config)

  cm-client.py <filename>
    Copy <filename> to the local harddisk. If possible, existing 
    copies on other compute nodes will be used. A central
    server instanced keeps track of the copies and controlls the
    number of parallel transfers.
    If there is not enough space left on the local disk (see 
    MIN_FREE and MAX_USAGE in the configuration file), older files
    will be deleted.
    The location of the cached file is returned on stdout. If
    the caching is not possible for any reason, the original
    filename will be returned.

  cm-client.py -cp <source> <destination>
    Copy <source> to <destination> and register <source> as copy
    of <destination> on the server instance.
